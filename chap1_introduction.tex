\section{Optical Microscopy}

The optical microscope is one of the oldest scientific instruments, and continues to be an essential tool for researchers, clinicians, and engineers across many disciplines. Microscopes are typically defined as having two or more refractive surfaces to provide magnification between the object of interest and the imaging plane, enabling the user to see things much smaller than the normal optical resolution of the human eye. Credit for the inventor of the compound microscope is generally attributed to Hans and Zacharias Jansen of the Netherlands~\cite{van2010origins}, although the first published work on microscope design wasn't released until 1665 (Hooke and van Leeuwenhoek) \cite{natureMilestones,hookeMicrographica}. The term "microscope" is generally used to describe optical microscopes - those which are designed for use with light within the optical band of the electro-magnetic spectrum ($390nm \leq \lambda \leq 700nm$), which is approximately the electromagnetic spectrum detectable by the human eye.

\subsection{Imaging and Resolution}
Light interacts with our world in many ways, including diffraction, refraction, reflection, and absorption. At optical wavelengths, many common materials (usually a ceramic such as glass) have favorable properties for refractive optics (providing significant phase delay with little absorption), facilitating a precise control of an optical signal using these elements. Imaging is the process of creating a copy of a particular optical signal at a different position in space, which is generally coincident with a film or electronic detector. In the simplest case, a single lens may be used to form a magnified image of an optical signal by placing the lens and detector at a particular distance from the sample - this situation is described by the imaging condition,

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{s_o} + \frac{1}{s_i}
\end{equation}

\noindent which relates the distance of an optical element to a object under observation ($s_o$) to the distance of a conjugate image ($s_i$), which is be magnified by a factor $M = \frac{-s_i}{s_o}$ based on these distances and the focal length of the optical element ($f$). A single-lens imaging system imposes many practical issues, including telecentricity (consistancy of magnificaiton across the field) and aberrations, both geometric and chromatic. Including multiple optical elements into a compound microscope can dramatically improve image quality by providing aberration compensation and telecentricity. Typically, the exact number and design of these components is abstracted to the end-user, and can be defined by a relatively low number of descriptive quantities despite the complex internal lens design of a modern microscope objective. Magnification and numerical aperture (NA) are the most important of these physical quantities; the magnification of an objective sets the field of view which is relayed by the optic, while the NA sets a minimum bound on the diffraction-limited resolution. The numerical aperture is defined by the formula $NA=n\sin (\theta)$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium, and $\theta$ is the maximum half-angle at which light may pass through the objective relative to the radial (optical) axis. The angular dependence of numerical aperture is completely described by interference effects which arise from the wave-optics model of light propagation. As multiple off-axis sources of the same wavelength converge to a point, the wavefronts of these sources will cause constructive and destructive interference. The minimum distance between two peaks formed by constructive interference is proportional to both the wavelength of the illumination and the angular separation between the two beams (which is set by the maximum NA of the illumination source and imaging optics). Practically, the size of this spot defines the resolution of the optical system. By the Rayleigh criteria, the resolution of an optical system is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro:rayleigh}
\Delta x_{min}  = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{(NA_{objective} + NA_{illumination})}
\end{equation}

This quantity defines the minimum separation between two points which can be detected by a system with a circular aperture, and is defined by the distance between the center if the point spread function (PSF) and it's first null. Note that Eq.~\ref{eq:intro:rayleigh} is dependent ono both detection side NA ($NA_{objective}$) and illumination side NA ($NA_{illumination}$). The ratio between these NA, typically denoted as $\sigma = NA_{objective}/NA_{Illumination}$, is sometimes referred to as the coherence factor. As $\sigma \longrightarrow 0 $, the illumination becomes spatially coherent, meaning the phase of the illumination wavefront at a given point on the sample can be perfectly described by all other points on the sample. This definition assumes that the light source is composed of spatially distributed statistically uncorrelated emitters - contemporary microscope sources such as halogen and tungsten lamps satisfy this criteria while in k{\"o}hler geometry. As sigma increases, the minimum resolvable feature size decreases, leading to images of higher quality, subject to aliasing affects. However, increasing $\sigma$ beyond 1 does not provide further resolution improvement due to the ballistic light (DC term) is not collected by the objective. This is the working principle of dark-field microscopy, which reveals high-resolution features, but does not localize them beyond the resolution of the imaging optics.

\section{Computational Microscopy}

\end{figure}

The concept of using computational tools to simulate and invert optical imaging systems was developed soon after the emergence of computers, based on the mathematical framework which was developed prior to this time. Recently, the field of computational imaging has expanded considerably due to increasing availability of computing power and digital sensing hardware. In modern microscopes, digital cameras allow the detection of the intensity of an optical field using a grid of photodetectors, which digitize the optical field and facilitate computational imaging reconstructions on a host computer. As graphical processors (GPUs) have become faster and more widely available, computational algorithms have likewise accelerated both in speed and scale.

An early example of computational imaging was the application of a cubic phase plate at the microscope pupil, which provides drastically increased depth of field but produces a highly distorted image. Since these distortions are known, however, the original image with extended depth of field can be deconvolved using knowledge of the system's point spread function (PSF)\cite{Dowski:95}. Since these early works, computational microscopy has ballooned due to the widespread availability of computing hardware and software tools for simulating optical systems and performing quantitative analysis. Prominent examples include super-resolution methods such as structured illumination~\cite{gustafsson2000surpassing, gustafsson2005nonlinear}, which enhances resolution by projecting a pattern onto the sample, localization microscopy~\cite{betzig2006imaging, Rust:06}, which employs statistical analysis to localize sparse fluorophores using temporal dynamics, and both conventional~\cite{rodenburg2004phase} and Fourier~\cite{Zheng2013} ptychography. Three-dimensional imaging has likewise become a powerful for imaging three dimensional biological quantities, and becomes absolutely necessary for high-$NA$ imaging of thick samples which encounter multiple scattering. Various approaches have been proposed, including deconvolving focal stacks~\cite{agard1984optical}, light-field microscopy~\cite{broxton2013wave, Ng2005}, point-spread function engineering~\cite{pavani2008three}, as well as diffraction tomography~\cite{wolf1969three, kim2014diffraction, maleki1992tomographic}. In addition, computational imaging has been widely used for quantitative phase imaging, using interferometry~\cite{Popescu2006,kim2014diffraction, Bhaduri:12}, Off-axis holography~\cite{Witte:12}, commercial add-ons~\cite{phasics,bon2012method}. Another add-on option uses two cameras to capture defocused images which can then be used to solve the Transport of Intensity Equation (TIE)~\cite{allman2005optical}. Alternatively, if chromatic aberrations are large enough, they can enable single-shot color TIE~\cite{wallerColorTIE} without any hardware changes.

Reconstruciton algorithms vary consideribly based on the desired application and acquisiton strategy, but most build upon theoretical abstractions provided by the Fourier optics model. The seminal text on imaging using Fourier theory to analyze imaging systems was published in 1968~\cite{goodman:68} which produced the framework which enables many common computational techniques such as deconvolution, holography, and the free-space propagation of an electric field. The Fourier optics description is especially useful for an optical system configured as a telecentric ($4f$) system:

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{intro-4f.png}
\caption{\label{fig:4f} Schematic of a 4$f$ optical system}
\end{figure}

\noindent In this system, the lenses in this system operate as forward and inverse Fourier transform operators on the input optical field at (P1) as it propigates through the pupil plane (P2) to the image plane (P3). In this configuration, the electric field at position P2 can be modeled as the Fourier transform of P1, which is often occupied by an aperture stop (circular low-pass filter) to limit the NA of the objective. This stop defines the resolution of the optical system, and can be used to reduce aberrations and prevent aliasing of the optical signal at the camera plane.

In most cases the propagation and refraction of light can be modeled using a small number of linear and non-linear operations, and may be accuratly simulated using linear algebra software packages such as \texttt{numpy}. With knowledge of this forward model, an inverse problem may be formed to recover the object without any distortitions imposed by the imaging system (provided the information is still present in the measurement). In computaitonal imaging these distortions are carefully designed to reveal contrast in ways a conventional system cannot, enabling the recovery of high-dimensional or high-resolution information using computation after an acquisition in performed. Many imaging inverse problems share a common standard form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_inverse_problem}
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{\vec{x}} = \underset{\vec{\vec{x}}}{\text{argmin}}
& & ||\op{A}\{\vec{x}\} - \vec{y} ||_2^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Where $\vec{x}$ represents the variable of interest (generally the object), $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ is the mathematical operation describing the optical system, $\vec{y}$ is the measured intensity, and $\hat{\vec{x}}$ is an estimate of the object $\vec{x}$. The forward operator $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ is normally formed based on the physics of the optical systems, need not be linear or represented by a matrix.

The goal of a computational imaging system is to invert the forward operator $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ in a way which minimizes the distance between the object estimate distortions of the forward-inversion process ($||\hat{\vec{x}} - \vec{x}||_2^2$). If $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ is linear, is can be inverted in a closed-form solution using the Moore-Penrose Pseudo-Inverse~\cite{moore1920reciprocal}, or with an iterative method such as gradient descent. If $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ is non-linear but smooth, it must be inverted iteratively using analytic expressions for each regularization. If $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ is non-smooth, it can, in some cases, still be inverted using iterative soft-thresholding method such as FISTA~\cite{beck2009fast}.

In general, linear problems (characterized by satisfying the relationship $\op{A}\{\vec{a} + \vec{b}\} = \op{A}\{\vec{a}\} + \op{A}\{\vec{b}\} $) are much easier to invert and solve, having lower memory requirements and complexity as well as a direct inverse. Linear convolution operators are particularly common for telecentric imaging systems. When a convolution is well-posed, it may be efficiently inverted using a FFT-based deconvolution algorithm~\cite{cooley1965algorithm}, which has complexity $N \log(N)$ as opposed to $N^2$ for normal operators.

The performance of inversion processes may be improved by adding regularization term to penalize certain undesirable characteristics of the signal, such as noise. The most commonly used regularization method is Tikhonov (or $\ell_2$) regularization~\cite{tikhonov1943stability} which enforces a prior on the total energy of a system. Tikhonov regularization is equivalent to adding an additional $\ell_2$ term to Eq.~\ref{eq:intro_inverse_problem}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_tikhonov}
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{\vec{x}} = \underset{\vec{x}}{\text{argmin}}
& & ||A\{\vec{x}\}-\vec{y} ||_2^2 + \alpha||\vec{x}||_2^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is a tuning parameter which represents the weight of the Tikhonov prior (normally set to $\frac{1}{SNR}$). If $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$ is linear and can be represented as a matrix, Eq.~\ref{eq:intro_tikhonov} can be directly inverted using a closed-form expression:

\begin{equation}
    \hat{\vec{x}} = ((\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} + \alpha \mat{I})\mat{A}^H \vec{y}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mat{A}$ is the matrix form of $\mat{A}\{\cdot\}$ and $\mat{I}$ is the identity matrix with the same dimensions as $\mat{A}^H \mat{A}$. This closed-form solution makes Tikhonov regularization popular for many inverse problems, although the total energy prior may not be accurate in all cases.

A second common class of priors enforce sparsity of the object in some domain. Mathematically the $\ell_0$ "norm" returns the number of non-zero elements of the input. This norm is non-convex, however, requiring a large combinatorial search which is intractable for most problems~\cite{candes2008enhancing}. As a proxy, the $\ell_1$ norm is conventionally employed as a convex, though non-smooth alternative~\cite{taylor1979deconvolution}. When coupled with a generalized sparsifying operator $\op{W}\{\cdot\}$ and a differential forward model $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$, this problem is convex, and can be written as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_sparse}
\begin{aligned}
& \hat{\vec{x}} = \underset{\vec{x}}{\text{argmin}}
& & ||\op{A}\{x\}-\vec{y} ||_2^2 + \alpha||\op{W}\{\vec{x}\}||_1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Because the regularization term is non-smooth, iterative solvers must be used to recover the optimal $\hat{\vec{x}}$. When $\op{W}$ is a unitary function $\mat{w}$ (or the identity matrix), a solver implementing proximal gradient descent using soft-thresholding may be used to minimize this objective function, such as FISTA~\cite{beck2009fast}, ADMM~\cite{boyd2011distributed}, or TwIST~\cite{bioucas2007new}. In general, $\mat{W}$ can be any unitary transform, including the Fourier transform  or Wavelet Transform, or a learned unitary operator which is optimized using a machine-learning framework~\cite{ravishankar2013learning}. In all of these cases, the optimal $\hat{\vec{x}}$ may be recovered by performing many iterations of proximal gradient descent:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{x}^{k+1} = \mat{W}^H prox_{\alpha}(\mat{W} (\vec{x}^{k} - \alpha \nabla_{\op{A}\{\vec{x}\}} (\op{A}\{\vec{x}\} - \vec{y})))
\end{equation}

In the case where $\mat{W}$ is not unitary, the above relationship does not hold, and other proximal methods must be used. One prominent example is total-variation regularization (TV), which enforces sparsity of the image gradients~\cite{rudin1992nonlinear}. TV regularization can be implemented using ADMM~\cite{wahlberg2012admm}, FISTA~\cite{beck2009fast}, or using soft-thresholding on wavelet coefficients~\cite{kamilov2012wavelet}, although it is known to create a "cartoon-like" effect for high $\alpha$ values.

\section{Noise in Computational Microscopy Systems}\label{sec:intro_noise}
All measurements contain noise from various sources, including photon quantization, camera electronics. In general, these noise sources can be additive or multiplicative, and may take on a variety of statistical profiles including Gaussian and Poisson distributions. In this dissertation, we generally assume the presence of an additive, Gaussian noise term $\vec{\eta}$ with zero-mean, and variance $\sigma_{\vec{\eta}}$, which is added to each measurement made under a general forward operator $\op{A}\{\cdot\}$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_forward_model}
    \vec{y} = \op{A}\{\vec{x}\} + \vec{\eta}
\end{equation}

This approximation is generally valid for measurements made with more than 10 photon counts, which includes every case presented in this dissertation (including fluorescence imaging). The effect of this noise on image quality is generally represented as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we use the common imaging SNR definition:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:intro_snr}
    SNR = \frac{\bar{\vec{y}}}{\sigma_{\vec{\eta}}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\sigma_{\vec{\eta}}$ is the standard deviation of the noise term. When inverting the forward operator $\op{A}\{\}$ to recover $\vec{x}$, the presence of $\vec{\eta}$ will lead to error in the measurements compared to the ground truth. Take, for example, if $\op{A}$ can be represented as a matrix $\mat{A}$, the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the object is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_noise_inverse}
        \hat{\vec{\vec{x}}} = (\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H y = (\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H \mat{A} \vec{x} + (\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H \vec{\eta} = \vec{x} + (\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H \vec{\eta}
\end{equation}

Based on Eq.~\ref{eq:intro_noise_inverse}, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between $\hat{\vec{x}}$ and the true $\vec{x}$ is $(\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H \vec{\eta}$. Taking the covariance of this term, we can find an expression for the covariance of the error term in the reconstruction:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_noise_covariance}
    \mat{\Sigma}_{\mat{A}^{\dagger}\vec{\eta}} = (\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H \sigma_{\vec{\eta}}^2 \mat{A} (\mat{A}^H \mat{A}) ^{-H} = \sigma_{\vec{\eta}}^2 (\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1} \mat{A}^H  \mat{A} (\mat{A}^H \mat{A}) ^{-H} = \sigma_{\vec{\eta}}^2 (\mat{A}^H \mat{A}) ^{-H}
\end{equation}

The main result of Eq.~\ref{eq:intro_noise_covariance} is that the inversion process re-weighs the spectrum of the original Gaussian white noise $\vec{\eta}$. When $\mat{A}$ has an $\ell_2$ operator norm of 1, the minimum singular value of $\mat{A}$ defines the maximum noise amplification, while the sum of the inverse singular values defines the total RMSE:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_noise_amplification}
    \sigma_{\mat{A}^{\dagger}\vec{\eta}} = \sigma_{\vec{\eta}} \sqrt{\mat{\Sigma}_{i=0}^N{\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2\{\mat{A}\}}}} = \sigma_{\vec{\eta}} \sqrt{Tr\{(\mat{A}^H \mat{A})^{-1}\} / N}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $N$ is the length of $\vec{x}$ and $\sigma_i^2 \{\mat{A}\}$ represents the $i^{th}$ singular value of $\mat{A}$. This definition is consistent with~\cite{agrawal2009optimal}. This relationship between the singular values of $A$ and the amplification of $\vec{\eta}$ enables a closed-form relationship to the reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR_{recon}$) of a measurement $\vec{y}$, defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_snr_recon}
SNR_{recon} = \frac{\bar{\vec{y}}}{\sigma_{\mat{A}^{\dagger}\vec{\eta}}} = \frac{\bar{\vec{y}}}{\sigma_{\vec{\eta}} \sqrt{\mat{\Sigma}_{i=0}^N{\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2\{\mat{A}\}}}}}
\end{equation}

Where $\bar{\vec{y}}$ is the mean signal of the measurement as in Eq.~\ref{eq:intro_snr_recon}. From this relationship, it becomes clear that the deconvolution process will reduce the $SNR$ by a factor:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:intro_dnf}
    f = \sqrt{\mat{\Sigma}_{i=0}^N{\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2\{\mat{A}\}}}}
\end{equation}

Where $f$ is the deconvolution noise factor (DNF). This result is particularly useful for convolutional forward operators, where the singular values of $A$ can be computed quickly and efficiently from the Fourier coefficients of the convolution kernel $h$ due to the circulant structure of $A$. This analysis of RMSE amplification is equivalent to A-optimal design~\cite{chernoff1953locally}, which is used here due to strict compatability with the definition of imaging snr (Eq.~\ref{eq:intro_snr}).

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig_intro_dnf.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:intro:dnf} Simulation of a convolutional forward model and verification of DNF calculations. Top row shows forward modal with additive gaussian noise, while the middle row shows the deconvolution of the same measurement, separated into object deconvolution and noise amplification terms. Bottom row shows the measurement and reconstruction SNR across 1000 random generations of the Gaussian white noise term, overlaid with the multiplication of the reconstruction SNR multiplied by the DNF as a verification. The operators $*$ and $*^{-1}$ represent 2D convolution and deconvolution, respectively.}
\end{figure}

As a demonstration of this relationship, we simulated a convolutional forward model with additive Gaussian noise, and performed deconvolution of the noisy measurement. These results show that the DNF provides a very close scalar relationship between measurement SNR and deconvolved SNR, which is illustrated by comparing the estimated measurement SNR (deconvolved SNR multiplied by the DNF) to the original measurement SNR. Small discrepancies between the expected and predicted SNR calculations are likely due to sampling error, since we evaluate the noise standard deviation across a 20 pixel square in the top left corner of each image, rather than the full image (to avoid including the standard deviation of the object in our SNR calculation). These relationships are used in both Chapter~\ref{ch:phase} and Chapter~\ref{ch:highthroughput} for analyzing the noise propagation of linear forward models.

\section{Coded Illumination for Optical Microscopy}


Since the 17$^{th}$ century, microscopes have employed some sort of light source to illuminate a specimen, from candles to semiconductor light sources. In this dissertation, we explore, through both theory and demonstration, the use of programmable LED sources for microscopy, replacing conventional sources such as halogen lamps. These sources enable both fast switching of qualitative contrast methods~\cite{Zheng2011, albeanu2008led} as well as the capability to perform quantitative reconstructions of the complete complex field of the sample~\cite{Tian3dDpc, Zheng2013, tian2015quantitative}.

Contrast in optical microscopy is conventionally obtained in a variety of ways - for purely absorptive samples, bright field microscopy images the light that is attenuated by the sample by illuminating within the range of angles defined by the numerical aperture ($NA$) of the objective. Conversely, dark field microscopy uses illumination from angles outside of the illumination $NA$, imaging only light that is scattered or "bent" by a refractive medium such as water. Rather than relying on expensive illumination hardware to block transmitted light at the pupil plane, the simple addition of an LED array enables both of these modalities by dynamically changing the pattern via software~\cite{Zheng2011, zijiMulti}.

In addition to qualitative phase contrast, computational illumination using a LED array enables quantitative phase recovery through with an LED array microscopy involves methods such as Fourier ptychography Ptychography~\cite{Zheng2013, Tian14} and differential phase contrast~\cite{mehta2009quantitative,
tian2015quantitative}, enabling the measurement of the dry mass of many aqueous biological samples~\cite{popescu2008imaging, popescu2008optical}.

In the following chapters, I will describe several novel applications and of coded illumination in optical microscopy, fabrication methods for coded illumination devices, and self-calibration techniques for the aforementioned methods, Fig.~\ref{fig:intro_system_dome} shows the system which was used in most experiments presented in this dissertation. Chapter~\ref{ch:phase} describes methods for qualitative and quantitative phase recovery, including single-shot quantitative phase imaging method which uses partially coherent color illumination to recover the complete optical field of an object from a single measurement. In addition, we perform a SNR-based optimization of LED patterns for linearized phase retrieval using a partially coherent source. Chapter~\ref{ch:highthroughput} describes a novel method for recovering a large field-of view with high SNR by introducing motion deblur during each capture and use a motion deblurring algorithm to recover the static object. We demonstrate the performance of this technique for both brightfield imaging and fluorescence imaging and provide an analysis of optimal acquisition strategy in terms of common system parameters such as camera noise level and illumination power. In Chapter~\ref{ch:fabrication}, we describe the fabrication of several prototypes used for coded illumination, including a programmable domed LED array, LED sources for high-throughput imaging, as well as Computational CellScope, a prototype device which uses a programmable domed LED illumination to perform quantitative phase imaging, digital refocusing, and multi-contrast imaging in a portable (smartphone-based) form factor. Chapter~\ref{ch:selfcal} describes self-calibration techniques for quantitative phase imaging, including LED position recovery for LED domes and aberration recovery using a linearized model. These methods are essential for practical implementation of many quantitative phase imaging techniques. Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} concludes this dissertation on quantitative microscopy using coded illumination, and provides future extensions of the work presented in the previous chapters.
